          "text": "Господь Чайтанья, также известный как Шри Чайтанья Махапрабху, является центральной фигурой в гаудия-вайшнавизме. Он считается воплощением Кришны, пришедшим в этот мир, чтобы распространить санкиртану (совместное воспевание святых имен Бога) и любовь к Богу.\n\nОсновные аспекты Господа Чайтаньи, согласно приведенным текстам:\n\n*   **Миссия:** Его главная цель заключалась в освобождении всех живых существ во всей вселенной и проповеди вечной религии. Он предсказал, что Его имя будет воспеваться в каждом городе, стране и деревне [[spl.spl\\1\\3\\index.html.null]]. Его учение универсально и не ограничено какой-либо конкретной сектой, религией или нацией [[spl.spl\\1\\3\\index.html.null]].\n*   **Учение:** Он проповедовал, что учение Господа Чайтаньи является высшей формой теизма [[spl.spl\\1\\3\\index.html.null]]. Принцип киртана (совместного пения) был предложен как \"будущая церковь мира\", приглашающая всех людей, независимо от касты или клана, к высшему духовному развитию [[spl.spl\\1\\3\\index.html.null]].\n*   **Лила (игры):** Его лила является источником нектара и жизненной силы [[spl.spl\\1\\12\\index.html.null]].\n*   **Преемственность:** Он занимает важное место в цепи ученической преемственности, начиная от Шри Кришны [[spl.spl\\1\\5\\index.html.null]].\n*   **Влияние на Бхактивиноду Тхакура:** Бхактивинода Тхакур, высокопоставленный правительственный чиновник, сыграл ключевую роль в восстановлении уважения к вайшнавизму, которое было подорвано. Он проповедовал, что учения Господа Чайтаньи являются высшей формой теизма и предназначены для всех людей мира [[spl.spl\\1\\3\\index.html.null], [spl.spl\\1\\6\\index.html.null]]. Он также предсказал, что учение Господа Чайтаньи распространится по всему миру [[spl.spl\\1\\3\\index.html.null]].\n*   **Универсальность:** Господь Чайтанья пришел не только для освобождения жителей Индии, но и для освобождения всех живых существ [[spl.spl\\1\\3\\index.html.null]]. Его учение универсально и не эксклюзивно [[spl.spl\\1\\3\\index.html.null]].\n*   **Квалификация духовного учителя:** Господь Чайтанья учил, что неважно, брахман ли человек, санньяси или шудра; тот, кто знает науку о Кришне, может стать духовным учителем [[spl.spl\\2\\49\\index.html.null]].\n\nВ целом, Господь Чайтанья почитается как самый милостивый аватар, который принес в этот мир самое легкое и доступное средство духовного самосовершенствования – святое имя Кришны, распространяемое через санкиртану."

Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, however, through his prolific writings and through his social position as a high government officer, reestablished the respectability of Vaiṣṇavism. He preached that the teachings of Lord Caitanya were the highest form of theism and were intended not for a particular sect or religion or nation but for all the people of the world. He prophesied that Lord Caitanya’s teachings would go worldwide, and he yearned for it. The religion preached by [Chaitanya] Mahaprabhu is universal and not exclusive. … The principle of kirtan as the future church of the world invites all classes of men, without distinction of caste or clan, to the highest cultivation of the spirit. This church, it appears, will extend all over the world and take the place of all sectarian churches, which exclude outsiders from the precincts of the mosque, church, or temple.

This church, it appears, will extend all over the world and take the place of all sectarian churches, which exclude outsiders from the precincts of the mosque, church, or temple. Lord Chaitanya did not advent Himself to liberate only a few men of India. Rather, His main objective was to emancipate all living entities of all countries throughout the entire universe and preach the Eternal Religion. Lord Chaitanya says in the Chaitanya Bhagwat: “In every town, country, and village, My name will be sung.” There is no doubt that this unquestionable order will come to pass. … Although there is still no pure society of Vaishnavas to be had, yet Lord Chaitanya’s prophetic words will in a few days come true, I am sure. Why not? Nothing is absolutely pure in the beginning. From imperfection, purity will come about.",

The Lord then saved Indra when Indra was covered by darkness due to the sinful reaction for killing Vṛtrāsura. When the wives of the demigods were trapped in the palace of the demons without any shelter, the Lord saved them. In His incarnation as Nṛsiṁha, the Lord killed Hiraṇyakaśipu, the king of demons, to free the saintly devotees from fear.

Their eyes resembled the petals of blooming lotuses, and They wore garments of black deerskin and bark, along with the three-stranded sacred thread. In Their hands, which were most purifying, They carried the mendicant’s waterpot, straight bamboo staff and lotus-seed prayer beads, as well as the all-purifying Vedas in the symbolic form of bundles of darbha grass. Their bearing was tall and Their yellow effulgence the color of radiant lightning.
